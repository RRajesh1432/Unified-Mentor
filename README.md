## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the projects I developed during my internship at Unified Mentor Private Limited. This collection showcases the diverse range of tasks I worked on, focusing on enhancing my skills in data science and analytics.

### Projects Overview

#### Project One: Crop Production Analysis in India

**Abstract:**
This project aims to analyze crop production data in India to identify key indicators and metrics that influence crop production. Using data science techniques, the goal is to predict crop production and provide valuable insights. Various tools and technologies, including Python, Tableau, and Power BI, are used to visualize the data and develop predictive models.

**Introduction:**
The agriculture sector is crucial for the overall supply chain and is expected to undergo significant evolution due to advancements in technology. This project aims to develop a Business-to-Business collaboration platform for the agri-food sector, facilitating effective and flexible collaboration among various stakeholders.

**Problem Statement:**
The dataset provides extensive information on crop production in India over several years. The primary goal is to predict crop production and uncover important insights, highlighting key indicators and metrics that influence crop production. The project involves creating views, dashboards, and a compelling story from the data.

**Objectives:**
1. Analyze crop production data to identify trends and patterns.
2. Develop predictive models to forecast crop production.
3. Create visualizations and dashboards to present insights.
4. Highlight key indicators and metrics influencing crop production.

**Literature Review:**
This section summarizes existing work and research relevant to the project and identifies gaps that the project aims to fill.

#### Project Two: Analyzing Amazon Sales Data

**Technologies:**
- Data Science
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

**Domain:** E-commerce

**Project Overview:**
The project aims to analyze Amazon sales data to uncover insights into sales trends, revenue metrics, and factors influencing sales performance. Understanding these aspects can help optimize sales strategies and improve business outcomes in e-commerce.

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):**
- **Extract:** The dataset is extracted from the Amazon Sales database, containing various attributes such as order date, ship date, sales channel, units sold, total revenue, and more.
- **Transform:** Data cleaning and transformation involve handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Load:** The transformed data is loaded into a dataframe for further analysis and visualization.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Total Revenue
  - Average Revenue per Order
  - Monthly Revenue
  - Average Order Value

#### Project Three: Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

**Technologies:**
- Data Science
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

**Domain:** Healthcare

**Project Overview:**
Health is a real wealth, and during the pandemic, we all realized the severe effects of COVID-19 on everyone, regardless of status. This project aims to analyze health and medical data to better prepare for the future.

**ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):**
- **Extract:** The dataset is extracted from a heart disease diagnostic database, which includes various attributes such as age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, and the presence of heart disease.
- **Transform:** The data is cleaned and transformed for analysis, including handling missing values and converting numerical data into categorical data where necessary.
- **Load:** The transformed data is loaded into a dataframe for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Minimum Age
  - Maximum Age
  - Mean Age
- **Age Distribution:**
  - Young Ages (29-40)
  - Middle Ages (40-55)
  - Elderly Ages (>55)
- **Gender Distribution:**
  - Male
  - Female
